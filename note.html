      It truly hurts i can't say this to your face
Hold your hands 
Interlock fingers 
Pull you by the waist 
Drag you closer to me 
Whisper in your ears
Gently kiss you on your forehead 
Happy Birthday 
I wish you a lot
But most of all i want you to be happy 
It's all I've ever wanted from the start
Way before everything else Thats happened between us 
I want you to be happy 
You're the most beautiful soul I've met
I could cry at how wonderful you are
I've never seen one as beautiful as you 
I hope this day marks the journey to lifelong happiness 
There will be bumps and it might get fucked
But i know my amorcit√£ can trump whatever comes


June 27th, etched into my heart, I'll be forever grateful 
Because on this day, God sent his most wonderful angel and I am honoured and forever grateful I met her

I love you 
Happy Birthday AgNESüåö
